## Project Overview

This guide includes three projects that will help you understand the key concepts of building APIs and SPAs with Laravel and Vue.js.

### Project 1: Building a RESTful API with Laravel 10

In this project, you will learn how to create a RESTful API using Laravel 10. You will cover topics such as routing, controllers, authentication, and database interactions. By the end of this project, you will have a robust API foundation to build upon.

### Project 2: Creating a Vue.js 3 SPA

Project 2 focuses on building a Single Page Application (SPA) with Vue.js 3. You will learn the fundamentals of Vue.js, including components, state management with Vuex, and routing with Vue Router. By the end of this project, you'll have a functional SPA.

### Project 3: Integrating Vue.js with Laravel API

In the final project, you will combine your knowledge of Laravel and Vue.js to create a full-stack web application. You will learn how to connect your Vue.js SPA to the Laravel API you built in Project 1. This project will cover topics like API consumption, authentication, and data synchronization between the front-end and back-end.

## Advanced Topics

After completing the three projects, you can explore advanced topics to further enhance your skills:

- **Optimizing Performance:** Learn how to optimize your Laravel API and Vue.js SPA for better performance.
- **Testing:** Dive into testing methodologies for both Laravel and Vue.js applications.
